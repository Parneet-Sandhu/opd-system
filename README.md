# OPD SYSTEM
Welcome to the OPD (Outpatient Department) project repository! This project represents a simple application developed entirely in Python with MySQL serving as the backend database. It serves as an introductory project for beginners learning Python programming and database management.
The OPD project is designed to facilitate the management of outpatient department operations within a healthcare facility. It encompasses various features aimed at streamlining patient management, appointment scheduling, and medical record keeping.
One of the core functionalities of the application is patient management, which enables users to perform operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting patient records. Additionally, the system facilitates appointment scheduling, allowing users to schedule appointments for patients with doctors based on availability. The application also includes functionality for maintaining comprehensive medical records for patients, encompassing diagnosis and treatment details.
Technologically, the project leverages Python as the primary programming language, with MySQL utilized as the backend database management system. The Python MySQL Connector library is employed to establish connectivity between the Python codebase and the MySQL database.
To set up and run the OPD project locally, users can follow the provided setup instructions. This involves cloning the repository, installing dependencies, setting up the MySQL database, configuring the database connection parameters, and running the Python script to start the application.
Contributions to the OPD project are welcomed and encouraged. Contributors can fork the repository, make necessary changes or enhancements, and submit pull requests to collaborate with other contributors.
Thank you for exploring the OPD project repository. We hope this project serves as a valuable learning resource for Python programming and database management.
